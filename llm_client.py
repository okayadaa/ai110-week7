Gemini client wrapper used by DocuBot.

Handles:
- Configuring the Gemini client from the GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable
- Naive "generation only" answers over the full docs corpus (Phase 0)
- RAG style answers that use only retrieved snippets (Phase 2)

Experiment with:
- Prompt wording
- Refusal conditions
- How strictly the model is instructed to use only the provided context

You will receive a developer question and a small set of project snippets.
Write a short, clear answer that a developer can act on.

Snippets:

Developer question:

Rules:
- Use only the information in the snippets. Do not invent functions,
  endpoints, file names, or configuration values.
- Prefer a direct answer when the snippets support it. Do not refuse
  just because details are incomplete if the main question is answered.
- Briefly mention which file(s) you relied on.
- Only if the snippets do not support an answer, reply exactly:
